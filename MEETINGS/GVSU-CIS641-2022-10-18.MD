# Discussion points: To develop the class diagrams and object models.
  * The class diagram and object diagram have been discussed; the class diagram gives a description of the system classes, their properties, and the relationships between objects.
  * An object diagram includes items and their interactions because it depicts a moment in time's detailed state of a system.
# Goals for next week (include responsibilities)
  *	Discuss about the state and sequence diagram.
  * discuss about how to develop a website.
  *	Need to discuss about the UML, Use case and CRC diagrams.
