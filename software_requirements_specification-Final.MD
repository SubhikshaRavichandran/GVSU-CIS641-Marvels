## Change management plan :

This section will talk about a plan for handling changes to the Badminton court booking application. It will focus on training users, making sure the court is available, making sure it works well, and fixing problems.

## Training Strategy :

- Firstly, the user must sign up or login by entering the required details.
-	If the user is new to the application, they will sign up by entering the required fields
-	If the user has already signed up before they can simply login to the application 
-	Then the user will be directed to the home page, where the available courts will be displayed for the users to select.
-	The user can select the Required court by choosing the basic requirements displayed in the homepage
-	Here the user can select the court size and the number of players they want to play.

-	The responses are being called from Html and CSS scripts. Multiple checks with user inputs and password validations. 
-	The web pages responses are being retrieved and to be checked the user feasibility.
-	Thus, this can be easily installed in any customerâ€™s environment.

## Discovered Issues and Solution :
-	The technical team in the backend ensures that the application works properly.
-  The rental sales and services will be given to the customers if they need the equipment.

## Traceability links :

-  In this part, we show how the requirements relate to other project artifacts including class diagrams, Use case diagrams, and activity diagrams.
