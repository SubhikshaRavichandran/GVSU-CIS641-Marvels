# Introduction

* In a summary, an online reservation system adds a booking facility to the website and allows you 
  to provide hassle-free booking to your customers. Moreover, if they want to book a Badminton
  court, they do not need to call and make an appointment; rather, they can simply choose the desired 
  date and time and confirm the booking after making a successful advance payment. That is exactly 
  what the play spots Badminton ground booking. If you want to book a pitch at any of our partner 
  facilities, we make it quicker than ever.

# Anticipated Technologies

* The backend data base for this application on web based is with RDBMS–relational databases respective with the java model view control method to be 
  loaded into web.
* In the front-end UI part we are using hypertext markup language and CSS script.

# Method/Approach

> The output is being called with API and controllers that would execute and return methods for output results.
  The responses are being called from Html and CSS scripts. Multiple checks with user inputs and password validations.
  The web pages responses are being retrieved and to be checked the user feasibility.

  * The project includes the Controller part as main code, that includes SPRING–MVC framework that is used to build the web applications.
    The HTTP requests and responses are managed from this framework. SQL is integrated with the JAVA in the backend and data is retrieved with integration of java and SQL DBMS. When there is a response request made from the front end then in the backend the data would be given response from the framework modules.



# Estimated Timeline
> To successfully complete the project, there are various key points and milestones.

  * The implementation would take some time because there are some major code fixes, and the front-end application relationships and project would be a 
    little bit complex. We anticipate that it will take some time to test the application's both positive and negative scenarios.
  * The task will be finished by the beginning of December (i.e 10th December) with Unit testing of the application.

# Anticipated Problems

> The anticipated problems would arise in the phases of unit testing of the code both front and backend
  Also, while development phase there might be possible errors and would need to test and fix the errors.
