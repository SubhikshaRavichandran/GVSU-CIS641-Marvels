# Introduction

* In a summary, an online reservation system adds a booking facility to the website and allows you 
to provide hassle-free booking to your customers. Moreover, if they want to book a Badminton
court, they do not need to call and make an appointment; rather, they can simply choose the desired 
date and time and confirm the booking after making a successful advance payment. That is exactly 
what the play spots Badminton ground booking. If you want to book a pitch at any of our partner 
facilities, we make it quicker than ever.

# Anticipated Technologies

* We plan to use JAVA for the backend of the application, together with HTML and CSS for the front end,along with Bootstrap and Java script for validation.
* We are using Oracle SQL with SQL Workbench to build the database and store the data.

# Method/Approach

> To develop this web-based application we need to create a relational database schema to work on the database. And need to
  make the controller and API call to return methods to send the output. need to write the html and CSS scripts to complete 
  the frontend part with responsive webpages. And test with other scenarios of password validation and user accessibility.
  the responsive webpages need to make and check the application feasibility.

# Estimated Timeline
> The project has various key points and milestones to complete the project.
  * Databases need to be designed and test the data and entity relationship of application.
  * The backend code takes much time to fulfill all possible ideas to create implementation classes.
  * Need to make the frontend webpages with HTML and CSS with good responsive way it will take some time to test the application.

  * The project will complete by the 1st week of December with all possible way tested scenarios.

# Anticipated Problems

> As of now we couldn't see any problemâ€™s in our project we might get in the implementation time.
